<h1>Operational Transform</h1>

<p>

  This is an experiment in operational transformation, done for the pleasure of doing it.
  The entry boxes represent two clients, the lower box the state on the "server"
  (which for now simulated in your browser).
  They will keep in sync as long as the checkbox is not checked.
  You can adjust the amount of network latency using the smaller text box ("1000" by default).
  Try checking the checkbox, typing in both boxes, and then unchecking the checkbox, for more controlled experimentation.
